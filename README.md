Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.

(1.1) A sequantial use of engineering steps to create, maintain and the stategies to create software products.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.

(1.2) a.The 1960s establishment of software engineering as a discipline.
      b.The 2000s rapid growth of Agile methodologies.
      c.The creation of programming languages.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.

(1.3) a. Requirements- documenting, researching and getting software requirements.
      b. Design- Making a user friendly, detailed architecture interface.
      c. Implimentation- Programming software step by step to meet the design specification.
      d. Testing- checking for bugs and insuring software meets standards and funtional requirements.
      e. Deployments- Releasing the product to the public and users.
      f.Maintenance- Updating, mainataining and keeping check of the software released to the public.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.

(1.4) {a.1}. Waterfall- Follows the procedure step by step until the completion of the project in a flow like state. 
      {a.2}. Can be used during the planning and creation phase of software were the all the steps and procedures could be coverd to insure that the software meets all requirements.
      {b.1}. Agile- Moves by being flexible and small work cycles that give feedback after every progress and tests each step.
      {b.2}. Can be used for updates, fixing code errors, mainly maintenance for the softawer after release.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.

(1.5) a. Software Developer- Implematation, programming and insuring solutions for software are taken care of.
      b. Quality Assurance Engineer- Insure the stystem software quality by designing and comming up with the tests the software should under go.
      c. Project Manager- They insure that the whole planning, testing and any other expects which are part of the software development are meet and taken care of.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.

(1.6) a. Integrated Development Environments (IDEs)- It helps developers create their code, test it and remove bugs from it. an example is VS code studio.
      b. Version Control Systems (VCS)- It hepls the team note what are the changes that have been made and by who, while supporting team work. Github is an example.
      
What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.

(1.7) a. The challenges are Changing Requirements, Changing Requirements and Technical Debt. This problems can be solved by having clear and concise communication, Priotizing taks on urgency and lastly rechecking or re-evaluating the goals and timlines.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.

(1.8) a. Unit Testing- is the testing of single modules/parts of a software.
      b. Integration Testing- is the testing of the system modules working together.
      c. System Testing- is the testing of the software as a whole.
      d. Acceptance testsing- is the testing of the sofware with users to insure it meets the user needs.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.

(2.1) The use of statements to make AI give a cleare and direct answer to your question.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.

(2.2) Prompt "Name the key reponsibilities of a software engineer during software development projects." This prompt asks for a specific set of work that a software engineer does durign projects allowing you to gain aclear understanding of what they actualy do at work.
